All those who are tested must be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, the following criteria will be used to determine if you receive prioritization for testing:\n\nHigh-risk worker (e.g. health care, first responder, law enforcement, mass transit)\nCritical infrastructure personnel (e.g. chemical, energy, water)\nLiving in a congregate setting (e.g. skilled nursing facility, assisted living, prison, homeless shelter)\nOver 65 years old\nImmunocompromised (e.g. cancer, HIV/AIDS, transplant, on immunosuppressive drugs)\nTraveled by mass transit within the last 14 days (e.g. light rail, bus, airplane)\nIf our team member determines that you meet criteria for testing, you will be scheduled for an appointment at one of our drive-through sites. Please bring your health insurance card with you if you have one.\n\nUpon arrival, you will be asked to stay inside your car and sign paperwork stating you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you agree to be tested and you will self-isolate until you are contacted by Banner with your test results. If you agree to these terms, a Banner team member will swab the inside of your nose to collect a sample. This process will take 5-20 minutes. You can then return home to isolate until we contact you with your results.\n\nIf your test results are negative, you can return to your normal daily routine if you are asymptomatic. Keep in mind you should remain at home if you are still sick. While you may have tested negative for COVID-19, it is possible you have another illness that could spread to others. Manage your symptoms at home and contact your primary care provider (PCP) if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nIf your test results are positive, Banner will notify the county and state health departments and provide you with next steps, which could include an additional quarantine period.

We also ask that participants utilize their golf cart, if available, when visiting the testing site.\n\nUnfortunately, test kits and supplies are limited due to resource issues at the state and national levels. As a result, we can only offer a limited number of testing appointments each day.\n\nAnswers to your questions below will help us determine which arm of testing you would be eligible for and will direct you to the appropriate scheduling page where you can sign up for a test appointment assuming testing supplies are available.\n\nPlease note that appointments for testing will be released 1 day in advance - with all test slots for the next day coming online each morning at 8 AM, so if testing slots are no longer available today, you will have an opportunity to sign up for a slot again tomorrow.\n\n***Test slots are allocated to those who sign up first.***",
